Welcome to my Python journey! ðŸŽ‰

This repository showcases the small projects I've built while learning Python. Each project is simple but highlights the different concepts I've been working on through my classes. 
This repository will evolve over time as I complete more projects, so feel free to check back often!

About the Repository


This repository is a collection of all the Python projects Iâ€™ve completed as part of my learning journey. My goal is to apply what I learn in small, focused projects, which range from simple exercises 
like detecting whether a number is odd or even to more complex projects as I progress.
By uploading my projects here, Iâ€™m also learning more about GitHub as a platform and version control. I expect some bumps along the way, but thatâ€™s all part of the learning process!
Feel free to explore the code, try out the projects, and learn alongside me.

Projects / Activities
Hereâ€™s a list of the small projects in this repository:

Odd or Even Detector
